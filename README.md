# Python-Web-Scraping-Script
I was tasked with writing a web scraping script with the goal of reading a large list of urls and recording the responses from each site hit. The script needed to record in a csv the site response/status (redirect, 404, or DNS Fail) and if it was an HCA HUT working site, then I needed to retrieve the COID, Site Name, Division, and the Site Type from the html.

To run this script, you need to have Python 3 and up installed.
